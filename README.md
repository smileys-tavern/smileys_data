# SmileysData

NOTE: This was a learning project and was rushed in many areas. The Smileys website refactor will coincide with this project getting a big facelift.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `smileys_data` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:smileys_data, "~> 0.1.2"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/smileys_data](https://hexdocs.pm/smileys_data).
