# SmileysData

Smileys Community Site data repository and associated logic

**Refactor mode complete.  There are still many improvements that can be made but the major reorg is finished, meaning future improvements are less impactful and can now be included with feature releases**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `smileys_data` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:smileys_data, "~> 0.1.2"}]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/smileys_data](https://hexdocs.pm/smileys_data).
